![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

Übersicht system information bar for use with kwm window manager. Inspired by screenshots of the [kwm window manager](https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm) and the [authors' NerdTool configuration](https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm/issues/8#issuecomment-166608067).

In the screenshot above I'm using the excellent [Hack typeface](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/hack). The version here uses Osaka Mono — in spirit of the original.

## Installation

Make sure you have [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) installed.

Then clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/herrbischoff/nerdbar.widget $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Übersicht/widgets/nerdbar.widget
```

## Caffeinating

When you find this helpful, you could buy me a coffee. Keeping me properly caffeinated accelerates things. And it would really make my day. Kindness of strangers and all that. If you can't or won't, no hard feelings. It's available completely free for a reason. Still, it would be awesome.
